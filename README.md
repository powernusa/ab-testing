# 📈 A/B Testing Analysis — Conversion Rate Experiment

> **Status:** Work in progress — actively updating as I build my data analysis & data intelligence portfolio.  
> Target completion: 31st December 2025.

This repository contains an end-to-end **A/B testing analysis**, including experiment design, data cleaning, statistical testing, power analysis, and interpretation.

The goal is to demonstrate a **professional-grade A/B testing workflow** similar to what mid-tier data analysts and growth analysts perform at product-driven companies.

More updates coming soon.
